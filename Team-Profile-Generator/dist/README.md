## Description
Technology used
1. html
2. css
3. javascript
4. node.js

## Purpose
This application takes in a user input from the command line and generates a developer team roster in HTML. Individual cards are created for each member that contain, name, id, email, role,and a specific sub category- either school, or github. Those cards are then created in html to generate a website based on the users input.
## Challenges 
One of the biggest challenges I faced was formatting the HTML. I eventually decided to solve this problem by first wireframing a layout, then building it into a static site. I then copied that HTML over into a template literal string that is dynamically written based on command line user input.

## Usage
    To use this open index.js in the integrated terminal. Run node index.js, then follow command line prompts.
